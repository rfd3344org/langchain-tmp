Ollama is a local runtime for open-source large language models such as Llama 3, Mistral, and Gemma.
It allows you to run models locally without needing an internet connection or API keys.

Chroma is an open-source vector database that is lightweight and great for prototyping Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines.
It stores embeddings and provides similarity search to find relevant chunks of text.
